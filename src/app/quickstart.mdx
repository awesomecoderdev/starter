# Quickstart

<Note>
	Before you can make requests to the Protocol API, you will need to grab your
	API key from your dashboard. You find it under [Settings &raquo; API](#).
</Note>

## Choose your client

Before making your first API request, you need to pick which API client you will use. In addition to good ol' cURL HTTP requests, Protocol offers clients for JavaScript, Python, and PHP. In the following example, you can see how to install each client.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
# cURL is most likely already installed on your machine
curl --version
```

```bash {{ language: 'js' }}
# Install the Protocol JavaScript SDK
npm install @example/protocol-api --save
```

```bash {{ language: 'python' }}
# Install the Protocol Python SDK
pip install protocol_api
```

```bash {{ language: 'php' }}
# Install the Protocol PHP SDK
composer require protocol/sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
	<Button
		href="/sdks"
		variant="text"
		arrow="right"
		children="Check out our list of first-party SDKs"
	/>
</div>

<div className="not-prose">
	<Button
		href="/conversations"
		variant="text"
		arrow="right"
		children="Read the docs for the Conversations endpoint"
	/>
</div>
